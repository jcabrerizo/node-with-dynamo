# Maeztro Tutorial: NodeJS with DynamoDB

This repository contains a small project consisting of a NodeJS application,
installed with Terraform to an AWS EC2 instance with a DynamoDB table.
This project is intended to show how Maeztro imports and manages Terraform-based deployments.

**See the tutorial in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder:**
This will show you how to deploy with Terraform then capture operations "as code" with 
the new Maeztro features in AMP.

Alternateively explore the Terraform [`deploy/`](deploy/) folder,
containing the [NodeJS app source code](deploy/src/), or the Maeztro code for the various
[`stages/`](stages/) of the tutorial.
